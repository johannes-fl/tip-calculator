## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SASS
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS
- MVC Concept

### What I learned

I used this challenge to improve my knowledge with CSS-Grid and to better understand the MVC concept. Even though it might be too much for this small application, I especially wanted to get a grip on the interactions of Model View and Controller :-)

Happy, I only needed to media-queries to get the app working!
